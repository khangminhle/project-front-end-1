					<h3>Here's a time line of Dr. Borlaug's life:</h3>
					<ul>
						<li><strong>1914</strong> - Born in Cresco, Iowa</li>
						<li><strong>1933</strong> - Leaves his familys's farm to attend the University of Minesota, thanks to a Depression era program known as the "National Youth Administration"</li>
						<li><strong>1935</strong> - Has to stop school and save up more money. Works in the Civilian Conservation Corps, helping starving Americans. "I saw how food changed them", he said. "All of this left scars on me."</li>
						<li><strong>1938</strong> - Marries wife of 69 years Marget Gibson. Gets laid off due to budget cuts. Inspired by Elvin Charles Stakman, he returns to school study under Stakman, who teaches him about breeding pest-resistent plants</li>
					</ul>
